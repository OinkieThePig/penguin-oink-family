                    <h4>Love God</h4>
                    <p>
                        I had a dream about a month ago if I am not mistaken. And Jesus showed up to help me when I was 
                        scared and hopeless. I surrendered to him in that dream and he helped me with my wish at that moment.
                        After that I called his name, asking to see him. And he showed himself to me. I was so happy and I
                        think I felt holy. It's still a feeling that I am trying to understand. The second dream was quite vague
                        yet I still felt his presence and I was immediately happy to feel the presence of Jesus. Ever since I felt
                        like sharing this, but I was not sure how the people around me would react. Except for my girlfriend who
                        is a believe herself. And she was happy to listen to my dreams and kept praying for me to find Jesus.
                        This week she introduced me to the Bible and creating a connection to Jesus. I am very grateful to say 
                        that she make this introduciton with me. Other than feeling happier and safer with Jesus around me, I still
                        need to work myself on this aspect. Because it's my connection with Jesus. Other than the feelings described
                        earlier towards him, this week my love towards my girlfriend felt a bit different. And not in a bad way.
                        Actually quite the opposite. It felt more safe. More beautiful. It felt more special than ever and stronger.
                        It felt as Jesus was watching above us and keeping our love safe and true to one another. It was like those
                        one of a kind moments that you have during a realtionship once in a while. I was genuinely happy and grateful.
                        I love you Jesus. Amen.

                    <h4>Being Independent</h4>
                    <p>
                        Well I am happy to know that I got a contract! And it is a nice workplace where I can develop myself
                        due to its dynamic environment and availability of projects. I am happy to know that my first project is
                        quite and interesting one and that it will be in practice for A LOT of people. I am glad that I can bring
                        growth to myself and that I can bring value not only to the company but also to the people using various
                        services. Some people are sick and need medicine, some want a beautiful trip with their families, or some
                        want to buy sweets. They will be able to use the interface that will safely make them get what they pay for.
                        Furthermore, I am glad that I finally have a salary! Yaaaay! I am also gaining work experience! Yuuupy!
                        I am happy with what I am working at the moment. Moreover, I am planning to be independent with my money.
                        I am going to pay my utilities(g., w., e.,), my groceries and then comes the expenses that are unpredictable 
                        or just things I want. I can pay them myself, with my own work. I do not have to pay health insurance because 
                        as long as I am employed I am ensured by the public health insurance coverage here in Romania. Furthermore, 
                        I am grateful to have a car from work, until I can get one myself! If I am not doing well myself then 
                        I won't be able to provide to the people I love.

                    <h4>Family</h4>
                    <p>
                        In that sentence family reffers to families. Mine and Miralda's family.
                        
                        <h4>From Criss for Maftei Family</h4>

                        I am glad that you opened my eyes my love. I had a very open conversation with my father and I was very bold 
                        with my parents. About what I feel, about my decisions and that it's up to them if they want to support my 
                        deicisions or not. I am taking the first step to accomplish what I want for myself. They were glad to hear that. 
                        And thank you God for my parents. They said that they will support me in whatever deicision I will take.
                        But! There is a big but. They said that they will be my "mirror". And that when they feel that I do something 
                        wrong, they will be as straight as possible with me. No bs, no mask, just straight facts and what they think 
                        and feel about certain aspects. Because as they said, even if it hurts, that is our support. We won't leave your life 
                        but sometimes support can hurt. God, thank you for my familiy. I love my family. I just wish that they will find you as well 
                        Jesus. I wish they would try understanding you Jesus. 
                        Funny enough I felt that from you my love(your support). I can't describe how I feel now, and how lucky I am. 
                        That's because you show me over and over how much you love and that you still fight for us. For our future.
                        For a God centerd relationship that leads to marriage and family. I love you. And fuck my ego. I want to put aside 
                        some things for you. I WANT that. Because my heart tells me so. My love for you.

                        <h4 style="margin-top: 2rem;">From Criss for Bonkie Family</h4>

                        I was blinded by my ignorance and ego about your beautiful family sweetheart. 
                        I was really happy with you and then until I feel into that bad state.
                        I don't know what triggered it, but I want to say that it wasn't with bad intentions. I miss the nights when 
                        I am sitting at the table with you my love, your mother and your sisters playing funny boards games. I once 
                        spend time watching holiday videos with your mother and it was a fun time! I am looking forward to exploring 
                        more beautiful island videos with your mother! With your father I spend a lot of time. And I grew in his eyes 
                        and sometimes I could feel it and sometimes not. But no matter what I am grateful tht your parents accepted me 
                        into their household every time. That they showed me, with the goods and the bads how they live with such a big family. 
                        I thank you for being true and bold with me in that sense. I think that I was so much by myself here(in NL) that whenever I was 
                        going back home I could only see the nice parts because my family missed me. And I forgot about their bad parts. 
                        And whenever those moments came up again, I was furious and choose to stay away because I was so selfish to 
                        consider that they are not supposed to have the "bads" in them. I am sorry my love for being egoistic, and selfish.
                        You have a beautiful that no matter what stayed together. And even when I did wrong they still loved me 
                        and it felt wrong for me to see them take my side over their precious daugther and 
                        tell me: "Cris it's going to be alright. She is high on emotions. She had a lot. We can see that you love her."
                        This means the world to me. Of course they are on your side forever and will always be there for you and your 
                        decision my love. I am still shocked that they want me. I am sure your parents still have their hard times 
                        and had harder times, and still fought for each other and gave chances over chances because their love and bond 
                        is strong. Thank you Bonkie family! I love you, and thank you for seeing me as a family member.

                        This section is going to take a while. I am still wrting. Not as if what I wrote was not from the bottom of my heart of my thoughts. 
                        But this is about you. And I want to make it special and then copy paste it here once I feel like it's complete.

                    <h4>Leaning Dutch</h4>
                    <p>
                        This one is pretty straightforward. And I will not make it about Dutch necessarily. Wherever we are living and building a life. 
                        We both need to know that language. For the time being, according to the list of my goals, and also to the uncertainity of life, I don't know where I will be. 
                        But wherever I will be and will have a family there. For the time being I need to know the local language. In this case I am willingly to learn Dutch. 
                        For a better communication and understanding what is written everywhere lol. For you and your family. And yes, I take this step for you. In a realtionship, 
                        to make things work, to grow and to build there are COMPROMISES. And this is one that I am willing to take. Love > Ego.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I found 2 teachers here. I can take lessons in private either in person or online, which is great in terms of flexibility! Tomorrow I will contact them 
                        to talk to them to establish the time and the number of times per week. I was thinking about 1-2 times a week. Becasue they will give me self-study material 
                        for sure. So I will have homework again soon haha. Yeah, a short text, but this one is pretty straightforward.

                    <h4>Our Relationship</h4>
                    <p>
                        With God's plan and work from me we will become closer. I got a wake up call and got out of this shit close minded life I was in for the past 
                        months. I am sorry that I did that to myself. I did not go down, and I did not grow. I was stagnant. 
                        Next to hurting myself I am devastated to what I have done to the one and only girl I love. She is so strong 
                        and she grows so beautifully every single time. My plan is divided on two sub-plans. To grow myself and 
                        to grow with her. I feel excited for that step. I want to live with you Baby. I want to be there for you to grow you and you to grow me. I know we can do that.
                        That's why we are here now and we are not broken up. You've been "seen" all this time and then not. After this beginning of this year I feel like I am coming 
                        with my feet down on Earth and being the Cris I really am. I got woke up calls one after another. <b>I got realizations that somewhere last year I went off my path by a lot. 
                        These few days with you felt like God send you to a dark time of suffering to take the person you love the most by the hand and bring it back to the path we were walking. 
                        And it was a hard journey for you, because I did not look you in the eyes and I kept being in the dark. Yet you still fought like a champion. Baby this is not for nothing. 
                        Jesus listened to your prayers. Jesus gave you strenth. And with that you brought me back at the cost of pain. I am grateful to still be on the same path. And I want to hold hands.
                        Through worse and through good. While writing my thoughts down I realized what you meant by "Cris, Jesus sent you to me". You were off your path and Jesus send you me. 
                        Let's hold hands and walk our path together. Let's keep on loving each other and loving Jesus, through our journey until the day we meet Jesus along the path. 
                        He is with us now. Watching us, and blessing us. And once I meet him along our path I know it will be my time to go to heaven. And I will see you there. 
                        In Jesus's paradise. Thank you for fighting for me. For us. You are my priority. I look to my right and I see myself holding your hand. I see myself holding your 
                        hand through beautiful lakes full of animals and nature that surrounds us and also thorugh flames. I see you. I love you.</b>

                        You. Yes you. The one reading this called Baby. Bubby. Otto Bubby/Baby. My Otto Bubby/Baby.Punciu. Punch. Dushi. Petutie. Honey. Sweetie. Sweetheart. Penguin. The Mommy of the Piggies.
                        Danysha Miralda Martha Peters. My love. My special + everything from the above. My one and only + everything from above. Smiley face.
                        Blue Heart. Mi Korason. Mijn Lieverd. Viata Mea(that is how you call someone you love unconditionally here in Romania). Love. Sexy Dushi. 
                        Everything from above + ending in "lina". My girl. My girlfriend. My partner. My wife. My wifey. My future wifey. The woman that I dreamed of my whole life.
                        The future woman that I want to grow OUR kids. The Mother of our children. <b>The woman that will walk up the isle towards me holding it's parents hands ready to make the vow under God's eyes that we become one.</b>
                        My favorite kind of flower. The key master. The <b>parking ticket holder</b>(haha). Oinkie's Mom. Lazy + everything from the above. Small + everything form the above.
                        Hood Girl. UCUPOWER's girlfriend. Wagyu Steak Enjoyer. The.. the.. AH ALRIGHT.. THE GORGEUS LADY THAT BEAT ME IN BOWLING... and last but not least.. 
                        the woman that I keep falling for over and over. You are my priority this. Us. To begin building a life with you. Thus, to do so, I have a set of goals for this year. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Keep on working and learning. I enjoy working and being in this environment. Gaining work experience and interacting with various people. Learning from the 
                        people around me. If things are not going well, then transitioning to another project. Understanding what work life really is about, with all the stress 
                        and challenges along the way. Learning to master my work and my craft. Always and always keeping an eye out for other opportunities. Considertaion is a good aspect.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Taking care of my mental state and physical state. Being more healthy and more sportive. Someone young is supposed to do sports regurarly.
                        Developing a nice routine that can be altered according to how I react to the changes along the way. Constantly analyzing and leanring the skill 
                        of transitioning from one thing to another. Loving myself and never allowing myself to losing myself.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I want to challenge myself. I want to give it a try and learn some things in my spare time. Among those things, the Number 1 is learning Dutch. 
                        I understand your point with that. It makes a lot of sense for the time being there to know the language. I apologize for being stubborn. 
                        After all, learning a language will make me smarter and it's a useful skill nowadays as many more people are willingly to learn more languages.
                        <b>By the way Baby! I found already 2 teachers and I will contact them tomorrow to see how we can establish a schedule and to have 1 or 2 classes 
                            of Dutch a week. The manner is private lessons, so they can do it in person at my house or theirs, and also online in a meeting! To be fair 
                            I am looking forward to it. It is fun to learn a language with someone 1 on 1. That's how I learned English and yeah, this is the way 
                            for me punciu.

                            P.S: Haha, we were practicing on the car on the to the airport, the order from Burger King. Funny enough, I was in the plane and I KNEW
                            how to ask for a cup of water and Coca Cola from the flight attendant. I was just nervous to speak Dutch. Now I understand why people are also nervous 
                            in the Netherlands to speak Engligh. Afraid of not knowing it good enough or not sounding good, I don't know. But this sensation was weird haha. I did 
                            not have that in a long time.

                        Keeping an eye on Jesus. Building my realtionship with him. And this can only be done with trying, accepting his as my Lord and Creator

                        I want to travel more. Lately I've been feeling that more. And maybe it sounds strange enough but I think I feel that more because I got a job. And I feel like 
                        I am working and being productive towards my growth, which means that I feel like having a valid reason to travel and have time off to relax. I sort off 
                        deserve it. Like I said <b>let's go to Spain next month. Wherever in Spain. Me and you. And I will provide with the work I put in.</b>.

                        That means progressing towards going up and growing. I like the way I am feeling now. I am looking forward to growing! I believe in myself! It's not a period.
