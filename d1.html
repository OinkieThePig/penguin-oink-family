                        <h2>Morning</h2>
                        I arrived quite late. My Dad and my Brother picked me up from the airport. We stopped to drop my brother off 
                        at my parents' house and then my Dad drove me to my place. We stopped there and we talked about what happened 
                        lately in my life and my Dad told me more about himself and about certain aspects. He also tried to reflect 
                        on his experiences and give me helpful tips. Some topics made me sad. I wished my Dad told me those things 
                        sooner. When I was little. But it was nice to speak more straight with my Dad, and I am glad. I readlized
                        that the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Of course I am different than my Dad on some aspects, but 
                        I was shocked to hear some things that he did and I also feel like doing them or do them. I honestly wish 
                        that he will find God as well in this life. 
                        <br><br>
                        I went upstairs and unpacked my stuff... because I cannot sleep without Oinkie or Oinkilina! And then I went into 
                        the bedroom and I saw Ping Ping and Boinkie laying there. They were awake and waiting for me. I was filled with joy 
                        and I started hugging them and loving the kids. We spoke a little bit and they were glad to see me, and I was too.
                        <br><br>
                        I couldn't not sleep yet. The room felt empty. So.. I decorated a little bit! If you want to see how, check the pictures section on 
                        the lower end of the page! Every page will have this format, where you can view the photos of that day on the lower end of the page 
                        he he. After that, I prayed and fell asleep, I was very tired.
                        <br><br>
                        I woke up with a smile. I had a beautiful dream. I dreamed of me and Miralda holding hands and walking happily. 
                        I cleaned myself had some food, and since I went late to bed I also woke up kind of late. So before going to work 
                        I prayed at 13:00, as promised. After that I took a pen and wrote on a sticky note what I wish and sticked on the door.
                        I will do this everyday to manifest my wishes. While I was dressing up, I received and unexpected call! Giorgie was calling me!
                        We talked to each other about our day so far, and about how we feel. I was happy to talk to him, and it made my day to be honest. 
                        <br><br>
                        Once in the car I drove like UCUPOWER on my way to work. It was a bit insane yet fun. I miss driving like that from time to time 
                        he he. Once at work I said hi to my colleagues and proceeded to work. I was slowly getting hungry and I was planning to go grab 
                        some food from the store. BUT just as I wanted to go my colleagues were feasting next to me and invited me for a sandwich. 
                        AND THEN. My Dad/Boss(lol) arrived with food as well. So I had some nice warm food and then went back to work. I showed my Boss 
                        the progress and then I asked him to show me sever-side because I would like to be part of that implementation as well. I want to learn 
                        with him that. He agreed that he will explain to me the architecture and how to implement the functionality. I then started reading myself 
                        the documentation before we both left work. I went to my parents' house to see my Mother and my Brother as well. And I started working 
                        on the computer for this project! Now I am doing this in my spare time, it's not the best I can or the most optimized or smart, but 
                        I want to create it and then do the small touches once I have more time to spend on it. Ernest came home mad from a birthday party of a 
                        colleague of him from the university he attends. He was mad because people were outside smoking and no one was really communicating with him. 
                        I felt bad and I told him to come with me to the bowling club to throw some balls and to clear out minds a little bit. He agreed 
                        with a smile on his face. We had fun there, and I had some time to reflect with myself. I drove him home and then myself as well. 
                        I ate a little and then I had a hard time sleeping but! I fell alseep the moment I started cuddling with Ping Ping haha.
